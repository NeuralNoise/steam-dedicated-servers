# Steam Dedicated Servers (with Docker)

Just some Steam game servers using Docker ;)

## Counter-Strike 1.6

Just run the command below to start the server:

``` bash
$ docker-compose up cstrike
```

Basic server configuration can be done in the `docker-compose.yml`, but if you want to change more stuff you can use the `cstrike/server.cfg` file, have fun!
